# General Knowledge Quiz
The game that we will be playing today is a general knowledge quiz game. There are 5 different questions for now and the answer selected will turn green if it is correct and red if it is wrong. This can only be known by the end of the game as we can go back to previous question and still answer the questions.

As seen in the picture above the score is given as the final answer is submitted.

The technology used to build this game was html, css and javascript.

The hard part for me during this process was selecting the answer and storing the correct answer and checking it. This was done using *radio* html function that helps in selecting answers and also checks it.

The other function that came in handy was the slide function so that the quiz question could be selected from one to another question once we hit next and previous.

For more future enhancement I will be adding sounds when the answer is correct and when the answer is wrong. I also want to add some anime congratulatory theme when every answer is correct in the future.
