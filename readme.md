# General Knowledge Quiz

The game that we will be playing today is a general knowledge quiz game. There are 5 different questions for now and the answer selected will turn green if it is correct and red if it is wrong. This can only be known by the end of the game as we can go back to previous question and still answer the questions.

As seen in the picture above the score is given as the final answer is submitted.


## Technology Used
The technology used to build this game was html, css and javascript.
- The html part was quite easy and smooth however I had difficulty styling with CSS. Javascript was also little difficult as I was not able to figure out the function on how to select and store answers. However after researching more I was able to figure it out.

This was done using *radio* html element that helped in selecting and checking the answer. 

The other function that came in handy was the slide function so that the quiz question could be selected from one to another question once we hit next and previous button.

From this project I learned that I need to practice more of CSS styling plus should work with object and arrays learn their methods and functionalities. This encouraged me to work on more small projects that can help me in using all the things I have learned so far in class. I will most prolly work in creating another game in my spare time just to learn 

For more future enhancement I will be adding sounds when the answer is correct and when the answer is wrong. I also want to add some anime congratulatory theme when every answer is correct in the future.
